# Parking Calculator

Programming exercise for AbacusNext.

Added a UI because I felt applying for a frontend role and not providing at least some sort of UI would be poor form :-)

The parking-calculator module in the src/modules folder contains the actual calculation engine.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` to excecute all the test cases.

## Running

Run `yarn start` to launch the app and play with the calculator via the UI.
